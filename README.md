# Pong-Game
HOPE YOU ENJOY MY LITTLE PROJECT THAT WAS MADE IN 2 HOURS

KEYS:
LEFT PADDLE :"w"->UP   "s"->DOWN          *DOESN'T WORK WITH CAPSLOCK*
RIGHT PADDLE :"Up"->UP   "Down"->DOWN          *USE ARROWS*

I'LL TRY TO MAKE NEW GAMES 


I TRIED THIS ONE BECAUSE IT'S SIMPLE AND BRINGS BACK OLD MEMORIES
